# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This project is an educational lab and does not publish production releases. Security fixes are applied to `main` on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
1. Email **security@confidentialcomputinglab.local** with details and reproduction steps.
2. Do not disclose publicly until maintainers provide guidance.
3. You will receive acknowledgement within five business days.

## Scope and Expectations
- The lab contains simulated cryptography and isolation; vulnerabilities will typically relate to validation or logic bugs, not real hardware issues.
- Please avoid submitting exploit code. Proofs-of-concept should minimise potential harm and respect the educational nature of the project. Include redaction notes for any sensitive data.
